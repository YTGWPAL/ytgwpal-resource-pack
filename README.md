# the ytgwpal resource pack
>[!note]
>as of 1.21, custom music discs are now handled through datapacks. i have no plans on creating a datapack to fix the discs, so instead you should install the [Jukebox Custom Disc Fix](https://modrinth.com/mod/jukebox-custom-disc-fix) mod. this mod originally fixed [MC-260346](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260346) (present in 1.19.4-1.20.6) but is now still needed for custom music in resource packs to work in 1.21+ without a datapack.
>
>this mod is only for 1.20.1+ minus 1.20.3, meaning 1.19.4, 1.20, and 1.20.3 won't work with the custom discs.
